<h1>Security Says Yes</h1>
<p>Welcome to my blog, where, assuming I don't get bored/busy and abandon it, I'll post about 
    <ul>
      <li>permissive securtiy cultures</li>
      <li>how to not be a blocker</li> 
      <li>sharing some ideas of things that I've found useful</li>
      <li>possibly an occassional rant</li>
      <li>laughably, some of this might be considered <em>thought leadership</em></li>
    </ul>
</p>
