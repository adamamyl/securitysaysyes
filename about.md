# About me

Hello. I'm Adam. 

My pronouns are `he/him/his`. 

I'm a seasoned technologist with experience being a CISO, CTO, DPO, Data Nerd, SysAdmin, mediocre developer.

I've taken companies through growth (and exits), security maturity journys, and picked up a few certificates, awards, accolades over the years. 

I'm trying to not say things "are obvious", which is part of the purpose of this blog &mdash; to share some battlescars. One thing I think we could do better as an industry is share more.

In some shape or another, I've worked with:
  - ISO 27000 family
  - PCI-DSS
  - PayUK
  - FCA Handbook
  - MAS TRM
  - SOC2
  - GDPR
  - AI Act
  - DORA
  - NIS2
  - UK DPA
  - Investigatory Powers Act
  - Fincrime
  - NIST AI RMF
  - CIS
  - OWASP
  - MITRE ATT&CK
  - ITIL

  I'm an advocate for mental health awareness and reducing the amount of events that put booze as a selling point.

I'm an Advisory Council Member of the Open Rights Group â€” a (leading) digital rights advocacy group.

For fun, I'm the Inclusion & Accessibility Leads for a biennial event, [EMF](https://www.emfcamp.org)
